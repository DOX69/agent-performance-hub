User: I need to write a python script to scrape data from example.com.
Agent: Sure, I can help with that. What kind of data do you need?
User: I need the product names and prices.
Agent: Okay, I will use the requests library and BeautifulSoup.
Agent: First, let's try to fetch the page.
Agent: [Code execution: requests.get('http://example.com')]
Agent: It seems I got a 403 Forbidden error. The site might be blocking bots.
User: How do we fix that?
Agent: We can try adding a User-Agent header to mimic a real browser.
Agent: [Code execution: requests.get('http://example.com', headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0...'})]
Agent: Great, that worked. We have the HTML now.
User: Okay, now parse the product names.
Agent: I see they are in <h2> tags.
Agent: [Code execution: soup.find_all('h2')]
Agent: Found 10 products.
User: Now get the prices.
Agent: Prices are in <span class="price">.
Agent: [Code execution: soup.find_all('span', class_='price')]
Agent: Extracted 10 prices.
User: Can you match them up and save to a JSON file?
Agent: Yes, I will zip the lists and dump to products.json.
Agent: [Code execution: json.dump(...)]
User: Wait, I also need the product images.
Agent: Where are the images located?
User: They seem to be in the div with class "product-image".
Agent: Okay, I need to look for img tags inside those divs.
Agent: [Code execution: soup.select('div.product-image img')]
User: And also, can we handle pagination? There are 5 pages.
Agent: I will need to write a loop to go through pages 1 to 5.
User: Make sure to add a delay so we don't get banned.
Agent: Good idea. I will add time.sleep(2).
