# Agent Rules

This directory (`.agent/rules/`) contains all the global instructions, behaviors, and best practices that AI coding agents must follow when operating in this project.

## Purpose
The files in this directory define the fundamental rules of engagement for AI agents, including:
- Core development conventions (e.g., Test-Driven Development).
- Security and safety constraints.
- Appropriate usage of tools (like `aph` skills).
- Best practices for web application development using modern IDEs.

## How to Use these Rules
Agents should reference these rules whenever starting a new task, making architectural decisions, or writing code to ensure compliance with project standards and maintain a high level of code quality.
