**A CLI tool for managing curated AI agent skills across all your projects.**

Install 241 skills for Gemini, Claude, and other AI agents — selectively, only what you need.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (3 steps)

### 1. Install

```bash
# HTTPS is recommended (easiest for private repos)
pip install git+https://github.com/DOX69/agent-performance-hub.git
```

### 2. Initialize your project

```bash
cd your-project/
aph init
```

This creates `.agent/` with **6 core skills**: brainstorming, git-pushing, expert-skill-creator, clean-code, systematic-debugging, verification-before-completion.

### 3. Add skills you need

```bash
aph list                      # Browse all 241 skills
aph search docker             # Search by keyword
aph add docker-expert         # Install a skill
```

## 📖 Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `aph init` | Initialize `.agent/` with core skills |
| `aph init --skills a,b,c` | Initialize with custom skill set |
| `aph list` | List all available skills (241) |
| `aph list --installed` | Show only installed skills |
| `aph list --category security` | Filter by category |
| `aph search <query>` | Search by name, description, or tags |
| `aph add <skill> [skill2...]` | Install one or more skills |
| `aph remove <skill>` | Remove a skill |
| `aph update` | Update all installed skills |
| `aph update <skill>` | Update a specific skill |
| `aph info <skill>` | Show detailed info about a skill |
| `aph version` | Show CLI version |

> [!TIP]
> **Agent-friendly help** — Every command supports `--help` (or `-h`) with structured output designed for both humans and AI agents. Each help page includes **PURPOSE**, **USAGE**, **EXIT_CODES**, **PRECONDITIONS**, and **EXAMPLES** sections, so an agent can programmatically understand what a command does, what it expects, and how to handle errors.
>
> ```bash
> aph add --help    # See structured help for any command
> aph -h            # Short flag works too
> ```

    ├── knowledge/           # Project context (architecture, tech stack)
    ├── methodology/         # How agents should reason
    ├── debug/               # Error patterns, benchmarks
    ├── sources/             # Weekly surveillance sources
    └── .aph-manifest.json   # Tracks installed skills
```

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Git**
- **Access to this private repository** (HTTPS is recommended)

### Authentication (Private Repo)
Since this is a private repo, you'll need to authenticate.
- **HTTPS (Recommended)**: Use a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) or Git Credential Manager.
- **SSH (Alternative)**: Ensure your SSH key is added to GitHub.

### 💡 Troubleshooting: "command not found"
If `aph` is not recognized after installation:
1. **Try the fallback**: Use `python -m aph` instead of `aph`.
2. **Fix your PATH**: Ensure your Python Scripts directory is in your system's `PATH`.
   - On Windows, it usually looks like: `%AppData%\Local\Packages\Python...\LocalCache\local-packages\Python311\Scripts`

```bash
# Check if you have an SSH key
ls ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# If not, generate one
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"

# Add to GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

# Install in editable mode
pip install -e .
pip install pytest

# Run tests (110 tests)
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Regenerate skills registry after adding new skills
python scripts/generate_registry.py
```

## 🤖 Automated Maintenance

This repo is maintained weekly by **Jules** (automated agent):

- **Every Thursday**: Scans AI research sources for updates
- **Registry regeneration**: `skills_registry.json` rebuilt automatically
- **Test validation**: All 110+ tests must pass before any change
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions runs tests on every push and PR

---

## 📝 Adding New Skills

1. Create a skill: `python .agent/skills/expert-skill-creator/scripts/init_skill.py my-skill --path .agent/skills`
2. Edit `SKILL.md` with your skill's content
3. Regenerate registry: `python scripts/generate_registry.py`
4. Run tests: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
5. Push and create PR
